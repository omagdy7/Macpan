# Description

- A very basic Pacman clone done in python using pygame library

# Run

- Open your favourite terminal

```bash
cd src
python3 macpan.py
```

# TODO

## Must DO

- [X] Setup the basic player movement mechanics
- [X] Replace the yellow circle with a pacman sprite
- [X] Setup the sprite animation for pacman
- [X] Setup collision with walls
- [X] Load the proper sprites for the map
- [X] Setup collision with the map
- [X] Develop an algorithm to make the ghosts find pacman in the map(BFS, A*)
- [X] Add the Algorithm for Blinky (Normal A*)
- [X] Add the Algorithm for Pinky (Normal A* + 4 spaces ahead of pacman)
- [X] Add the ghosts in the game
- [X] Setup the sprite animation for the ghosts
- [X] Add the Algorithm for Clyde (Same as Blinky excepts when he gets 8 tiles close to pacman he retreats, So he is basically useless)
- [X] Add the Algorithm for Inky (Ambush)

## Optional

- [X] Add scattered mode for the ghosts
- [X] Add firghtened mode for the ghosts
- [ ] Add powerups
- [ ] Setup a menu for the game
- [ ] Setup a simple score system
- [ ] Setup a proper sfx/audio for the game

## EXTRA BONUS

- [ ] Make a nueral network agent that fully plays the game alone using reinforcment learning and PyTorch
